            <p>
              Welcome to the Alpha Chapter of Kappa Theta Pi. Kappa Theta Pi is proud to be the first professional co-ed technology fraternity in the country. We have always been one of the most diverse groups at the University of Michigan, open to students of all genders, majors, ethnicities, sexualities, and backgrounds. We are centered around our 5 pillars: professional development, alumni connections, social growth, technological advancement, and academic support.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our mission is to bring together students who are passionate about tech and build a strong, lifelong community. KTP has fostered this community into growing stronger, more connected, and more inclusive than ever before.
            </p>

            <!-- <p>
              KTP would not be what it is without the amazing members that come from all around campus. We are all connected through our shared passion for technology, and through this, you get the opportunity to meet some of your closest friends, peers and mentors. Some of my favorite events include painting the rock with my pledge class, or going to a Detroit Pistons game with other brothers.
            </p> -->
            <p>
              Now, as a senior, I can look back at my time at Michigan and without a doubt say joining KTP was one of the best decisions I have made, both in my professional development and by introducing me to lifelong friends. I am excited to continue to serve as KTP’s president, and I will continue to work hard with our members to push KTP to greater heights.
            </p>
            <p>
              Thank you,<br>Simrun Buttar

              KTP was founded on January 10, 2012, with the mission to create a tech community that enthusiastic students could join. In making KTP, the founders set up a strong community that has only grown in the 8 years since its inception.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our members come from all around campus. We are designers, analysts, computer scientists, engineers, artists, entrepreneurs, economists, philosophers, psychologists, and more. What makes the KTP community strong is our shared passion for technology and our unique backgrounds meshing together as one.

              Our alumni are part of an extensive and tight-knit network that stretches across the country.

Our alumni provide valuable insight for our members’ professional development.

            <p>
              I barely knew how to code when I rushed KTP, and I didn’t believe that I would ever truly feel like a “techie”. I expected an intimidating code-bro environment, but instead I found warmth, and support from a diverse and accomplished group. After three and a half years, I can easily say that I owe my job, my best friends, and so much more to KTP.

            <p>
              KTP was like another family to me during my time at Michigan. I have never been part of a community of individuals who shared similar interests as me. It allowed me to meet such wonderful people that I still talk to even in post grad life! No matter where in the country I travel, there is always someone from KTP to meet up with and just catch up!

              Above all else, KTP brought me people. It brought me people to commiserate through courses with. People to push, challenge, inspire me. People to learn, change, grow with. People to love & be loved by. The people & the ways we grew together stayed with me even now, long after graduation.
